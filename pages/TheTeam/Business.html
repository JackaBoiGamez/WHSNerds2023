                <h1>Team Exhibit:<br>
                    The Team Exhibit is an informal interview booth constructed and occupied by the WHS Nerds. Informal interviews are utilized by us to present our product and company to those interested in STEM. Presenters often work in duos, aiding each other as they present. WHS Nerds employees often use informal interviews to prepare for future events and involvement in the marketing presentation. The presenters are not limited to informal interviews, however they are the most common form of interview used by them.

                <h1>Marketing Team:<br>
                    The marketing team organizes and presents the sale's pitch of our product. This formal interview is not only pitched to judges at B.E.S.T competitions; the team also presents at the Elmore County Spring Board of Education meeting and the companyâ€™s Montgomery Industry Partners breakfast. Frequently, those in marketing presentations become involved in business administration as a career path.

                <h1>Notebook Team:<br>
                    The engineering notebook is a document encompassing the entire process of the robot's creation in extensive detail. It is written over the entire course of the robotics season, beginning after the game parameters are received at Kickoff. Within the engineering notebook is the entire engineering process, the research paper, evaluation charts utilized for robot creation, and the software development process. The contributors to the notebook learn valuable documentation skills and strengthen their writing ability.
